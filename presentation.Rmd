## Can we predict the number of medals won by a team at the Olympics? What factors can we use?

# A brief overview of the data

---

# Initial exploration

- We explored the data set that includes basic bio data on athletes and medal results from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016

-- 

- Here's what we saw:

--

- The top 5 countries with the most Olympians were: USA, France, Great Britain, Italy, and Germany

--

- The biggest contingents by sports were: USA (Athletics), USA (Swimming), Australia (Swimming), USA (Basketball), Canada (Ice Hockey)

--

- The top 5 countries with the most medals were: United States, Soviet Union, Germany, Australia, Russia (can see how the data itself is slightly problematic here)

--

- Roughly 4.9% (15% total) of athletes win a gold, silver or bronze medal each. 85% of the athletes at the Olympics have not won medals

---
# What we did
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Prepare data

  filter(season == "Summer") %>%
  group_by(year) %>%  # Group by year
  mutate(
    age = ifelse(is.na(age), mean(age, na.rm = TRUE), age),
    weight = ifelse(is.na(weight), mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE), weight),
    height = ifelse(is.na(height), mean(height, na.rm = TRUE), height)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(year, noc) %>% # Group by year and team (country)
  summarise(
    season = first(season),
    total_medals = n(), # Total medals won
    num_athletes = n_distinct(id), # Number of unique athletes
    avg_age = mean(age), # Average age of athletes
    avg_height = mean(height), # Average height
    avg_weight = mean(weight), # Average weight
    is_host = if_else(any(noc == host_country), 1, 0), # Check if NOC is the host
    .groups = 'drop'
  ) %>%
  arrange(year) %>% # Arrange by year for cumulative calculation
  group_by(noc) %>%
  mutate(
    medals_before = cumsum(total_medals) - total_medals) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(is_host = as.factor(is_host))

# Prepare data
medals_winter <- olympic_medals %>%
  filter(season == "Winter") %>%
  group_by(year) %>%  # Group by year
  mutate(
    age = ifelse(is.na(age), mean(age, na.rm = TRUE), age),
    weight = ifelse(is.na(weight), mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE), weight),
    height = ifelse(is.na(height), mean(height, na.rm = TRUE), height)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(year, noc) %>% # Group by year and team (country)
  summarise(
    season = first(season),
    total_medals = n(), # Total medals won
    num_athletes = n_distinct(id), # Number of unique athletes
    avg_age = mean(age), # Average age of athletes
    avg_height = mean(height), # Average height
    avg_weight = mean(weight), # Average weight
    is_host = if_else(any(noc == host_country), 1, 0), # Check if NOC is the host
    .groups = 'drop'
  ) %>%
  arrange(year) %>% # Arrange by year for cumulative calculation
  group_by(noc) %>%
  mutate(
    medals_before = cumsum(total_medals) - total_medals) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(is_host = as.factor(is_host))
```

- We split the data into Winter and Summer and identified 7 predictors 

--

- These were- average age, average height, average weight, previous medals, number of athletes, year of the Olympics and if they were the host country.

---
# Findings
- Our main finding was that the largest errors emerge when there are few medals (for both models)

--

- In the second model, 
  - For teams with more than 25 medals, the average error is 6.8%.
  - The MAE is 1.8, which is 7.8% of the mean (23.5) and we think that is a reasonable fit.

---
# Findings
- Like the Summer Olympics, bigger differences when predicted number of medals is low.

- Both models have no particularly big, noticeable differences and will give similar values.

--- 

# Conclusions
- Number of athletes, as expected, is present in all models with rmse = 3 (1 s.f). It does impact the likelihood of winning a medal
- number of athletes, as expected, is present in all models with MAE = 2 to 1 sf
* models without num_athletes have MAE of at least 18 for Summer and 7 for Winter Olympics
- There is less data for Winter Olympics (started in 1924) which leads to less accurate predictions
- There is a lot of missing data for early Games in general, some values (age, height, weight) have been substituted for average values for that year and season
- There are issues tracking medals won before for countries like Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, East/West Germany
